# GPS Sensor

#### Project Overview

The GPS Sensor project enables an Arduino Nano to receive and interpret data from a GPS module, allowing you to track location coordinates. This project is valuable for applications such as vehicle tracking, navigation systems, and location-based services.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **GPS Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect GPS Module to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the RX pin of the GPS module to pin 2 (TX) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the TX pin of the GPS module to pin 3 (RX) on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the GPS module to the Arduino Nano according to the circuit setup.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Select the appropriate board (Arduino Nano) and port from the Tools menu.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - Observe the latitude and longitude coordinates printed on the serial monitor to track the GPS location.

#### Applications

- **Vehicle Tracking:** Monitor and track the real-time location of vehicles for logistics and fleet management.
- **Navigation Systems:** Integrate GPS sensors into navigation devices for accurate positioning and routing.
- **Location-Based Services:** Develop applications that provide location-specific information and services based on GPS data.

#### Notes

- Ensure correct wiring and connection between the GPS module and the Arduino Nano.
- The GPS module requires a clear view of the sky to receive satellite signals effectively.
- Experiment with different GPS modules and antenna configurations for optimal performance and accuracy.
